git-s3
======

Easy way to deploy your git repo to a AWS S3 bucket. (Very early version)


## Install
1. clone this repository
2. run `composer install`
3. clone your own repository you'd like to deploy in the folder "repo"
4. insert your credentials in the config.yml

## Usage
```
./git-s3 deploy
```
Nothing more. Cool, huh?
